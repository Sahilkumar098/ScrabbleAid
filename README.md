# ScrabbleAid
Scrabble Aid is an iOS application that uses the power of machine learning to check the validity of the state of a particular Scrabble board. The application utilizes the Tensorflow Lite framework to determine the position of a Scrabble board and its tiles when captured by the device's camera, and it uses the MLKit framework to recognize the letter each tile on the board represents. 

Finally, the application allows the user to visualize the traversal through the Scrabble board performed for its validation, as well as the location of particular words on the board.
